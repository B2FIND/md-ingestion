### md-ingestion

The python script `manager.py` in this directory provides functionality required for
ingestion (including OAI harvesting, semantic mapping (see 
[repo 'md-mapping'](https://github.com/EUDAT-B2FIND/md-mapping)) and uploading 
to CKAN) of metadata in the [B2FIND portal](http://b2find.eudat.eu/).
The script manager.py uses the classes and functions from

`B2FIND.py` - classes for JMD management:
  - CKAN_CLIENT  Executes CKAN APIs (interface to CKAN)
  - HARVESTER
  - CONVERTER
  - UPLOADER

### Installation

Use Python 3.6.

Get sources from github:

```
git clone https://github.com/EUDAT-B2FIND/md-ingestion.git
cd md-ingestion
```

And run the installation:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Use a conda environment

Install conda: 
https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/

You can use a conda environment with Python 3.6.

```
conda create -n b2findpy3.6 python=3.6 pip
conda activate b2findpy3.6
```

Run the installation:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

```
manager.py [ OPTIONS ]
```

### Description

Management of metadata within EUDAT Joint Metadata Domain (JMD), i.e.

Ingestion of metadata comprising:

1. Harvesting of XML files from OAI-PMH MD provider(s)
2. Converting XML to Jason and semantic mapping of tags to CKAN fields
3. Uploading resulting JSON {key:value} dict's as datasets to JMD portal


### Options

```
--version               show program's version number and exit

--help, -h              show this help message and exit

--verbose, -v           increase output verbosity (e.g., -vv is more than -v)

--jobdir=JOBDIR          directory where log, error and html-result files are
                        stored. By default directory is created as
                        startday/starthour/processid .

--mode= h | harvest | c | convert | u | upload | h-c | c-u | h-u | h-d | d | delete
                         This can be used to do a partial workflow. If you use
                        converting without uploading the data will be stored
                        in .json files. Default is "h-u" which means a totally
                        ingestion with (h)arvesting, (c)onverting and
                        (u)ploading to a CKAN database.

--check_mappings=BOOLEAN
                        Check all mappings which are stored in './maptables/'
                        for converting the .xml in .json format and choose the
                        mapping table with the best results.

--community=STRING, -c STRING
                        community where data harvested from and uploaded to

--fromdate=DATE         Filter harvested files by date (Format: YYYY-MM-DD-hh-
                        mm-ss).

--epic_check=FILE       check and generate handles of CKAN datasets in handle
                        server EPIC and with credentials as specified in given
                        credstore file

--ckan_check=BOOLEAN    check existence and checksum against existing datasets
                        in CKAN database

--outdir=PATH, -d PATH  The absolute root dir in which all harvested files
                        will be saved. The converting and the uploading
                        processes work with the files from this dir. (default
                        is '/oaidata')
```

### Multi Mode Options

Use these options if you want to ingest from a list in a file.
```
--list=FILE, -l FILE    list of OAI harvest sources (default is
                        ./harvest_list)

--parallel=PARALLEL     [DEPRECATED]
```

### Single Mode Options

Use these options if you want to ingest from only ONE source.
```
--source=PATH, -s PATH  A URL to .xml files which you want to harvest

--verb=STRING           Verbs or requests defined in OAI-PMH, can be
                        ListRecords (default) or ListIdentifers here

--mdsubset=STRING       Subset of harvested meta data

--mdprefix=STRING       Prefix of harvested meta data
```


### Upload Options

These options will be required to upload an dataset to a CKAN database.
```
--iphost=IP, -i IP      IP adress of JMD portal (CKAN instance)

--auth=STRING           Authentification for CKAN APIs (API key, iby default
                        taken from file $HOME/.netrc)
```
