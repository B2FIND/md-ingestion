      <dc:description xml:lang="en">The primary purpose of this survey is to collect data on the salaries, tenure, and fringe benefits of full-time instructional faculty by contract length, sex, and academic rank. These data permit analysis, from a national perspective, of the number and tenure status of full-time faculty members in relation to enrollment and number of degrees granted, and the evaluation of faculty compensation in relation to institutional financial resources for an indication of the economic status of institutions. These data also enable trend analysis of average full-time salaries for an assessment of the economic status of full-time faculty. Salary data include total salary outlays and the total number of instructional faculty that were paid those outlays. Tenure data include number of faculty with tenure, number on tenure track, and number not on tenure track. Benefits data include fringe benefit expenditures and the number of full-time faculty covered by retirement, medical/dental, and group life insurance plans.</dc:description>
