The imbalance of oxygen leads to a nonstoichiometric compound in which the oxygen occurs in the form of O2\u2013 ions. Intrinsic oxygen defects are found to be unable to trap excess electrons. For low Fermi energies, the formation of peroxy linkages is found to be favored leading to the capture of holes. The relative +2/0 defect levels occur at 2.5 eV from the valence band.",
