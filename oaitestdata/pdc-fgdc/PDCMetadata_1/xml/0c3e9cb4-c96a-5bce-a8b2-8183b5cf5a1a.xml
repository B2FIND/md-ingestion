          <abstract>All monitoring occurs within the ARCN (Arctic Inventory and Monitoring Network) using a "vegetation node" framework of clustered sampling plots.  As of 2013, the project had sampled 23 "nodes."  Each vegetation node consists of a set of approximately 20 plots accessed from a central campsite. The node locations are chosen to be readily accessible and representative of major ARCN ecosystems. All nodes to date are accessible by fixed-wing aircraft landing on lakes or undeveloped gravel airstrips. The vicinity of each node is stratified into landform-based physiographic units, and proposed transect locations are placed within the strata. Transect starting points and azimuths are randomized, and plots are located systematically thereafter. A few plots locations were deliberately chosen to target features of special interest. Plots locations are recorded with a sub-meter resolution GPS and marked with a buried magnet for future re-sampling. At each plot, plant cover and height by species (or species group for many non-vascular plants) are measured by point intercept using a laser at 100 points spaced 25 cm apart (Fig. 3). Tree and sapling diameters, and seedling counts by species are made on an 8-m radius fixed-area plot (no trees were recorded in 2013). Comprehensive site and soil descriptions are made at each plot, and the intensity of herbivore effects on vegetation are assessed.</abstract>
          <purpose>1) Characterize changes in ungulate habitat quality and quantity over time, particularly reindeer and caribou winter range condition (e.g., sensitive lichen communities measured both by plots and with exclosures, biomass of forage species or groups of interest); 2) Determine changes to lichen and bryophyte communities associated with increasing inputs of sulfur, nitrogen or metals in active mining areas; 3) Determine the effects of fire and burn severity on the species composition (species diversity and % cover), vegetation structure (tree diameters and heights), and ground cover (% cover and depth) of varying vegetation types; 4) Determine vegetation change over time associated with contaminants (e.g., changes to lichen and bryophyte communities associated with increasing inputs of sulfur, nitrogen or metals in active mining areas); 5) Monitor long-term changes in lichen abundance and diversity; 6) Monitor long-term changes in plant structure - the height and density of plants - using ground plots that can be tied to remotely sensed imagery, such as aerial photographs and satellite images, for extrapolation over large areas.</purpose>
