        "Monthly ice motion fields for the Beaufort Sea are derived from the existing operational image archive of RADARSAT imagery combined with a new ice tracking algorithm. These motion estimates will be used to quantify sea ice dynamics within the Beaufort Sea region, in order to provide meaningful baseline information as well as identify the observed variability, trends, and extreme events. This high resolution, satellite-derived ice motion information will also serve to evaluate a new regional sea ice forecasting system in preparation for operational implementation at Environment Canada."

This high resolution, satellite-derived ice motion information will also serve to evaluate a new regional sea ice forecasting system in preparation for operational implementation at Environment Canada.;Summary: Sea ice within the Beaufort Sea region circulates according to the pre-dominantly anti-cyclonic Beaufort Gyre, but very little quantitative information about sea ice motion exists. Sea ice motion products were derived for the Beaufort Sea region using the Canadian Ice Service's (CIS) operational archive of RADARSAT-1 and RADARSAT-2 imagery and Environment Canada's new sea ice motion tracking algorithm. This analysis fills a considerable knowledge gap with respect to sea ice dynamics in the Beaufort Sea region. The results of this analysis will establish a baseline sea ice motion dataset which can be used for sea ice and climate model validation, and to plan and support future offshore operations.
