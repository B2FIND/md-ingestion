        "Concerns have arisen over possible declines in ringed seal numbers in nearby western Hudson Bay as indicated by reduced pregnancy rate, pup survival and abundance, and older age structure. Ringed seals are numerically, nutritionally, and economically one of the most important marine mammal species to Inuit communities of Hudson Bay, so knowledge of where and how seals use the bay is needed. As part of a larger project to assess ringed seal population dynamics and diet with climate change, this study focuses on ringed seal movements and haul-out behaviour, assess critical habitat, and investigate characteristics of foraging behaviour. We will further examine how similar metrics of behavior and habitat use for polar bears in the same region overlap. This project describes the collection and analysis of these data for ringed seals."
