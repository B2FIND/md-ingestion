        "Balloon launches carrying the rawinsonde instrumentation were made at least once per day to provide continuous physical sampling of the troposphere.  Balloon launches were also used to profile low-pressure systems, cyclones, and periods of significant warm or cold-air advection aloft.  Radiosonde data provides a high-frequency sample of atmospheric temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and geopotential height.  These data are also used to validate the performance of our ship-based MicroWave atmospheric Radiometer Profiler (MWRP)."
