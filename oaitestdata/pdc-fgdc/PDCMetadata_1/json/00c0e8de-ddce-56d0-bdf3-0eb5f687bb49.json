        "The goal of this multi-year project was to provide Yukon-decision makers with essential information regarding climate change impacts and projected changes in a central and accessible manner to enable informed decisions regarding adaptation in Yukon. The overall objectives for this project were: (1) to gather historical and current climatic data to determine gaps in knowledge and monitoring; (2) to determine the key indicators of climate change in Yukon; (3) to support the development of regional climate change scenarios in Yukon; and (4) to communicate results and scenario information to decision makers, communities, and other stakeholders. Focus was placed on building capacity in Yukon in the first year and was directed at the inventory of knowledge and analysis components of the project in the second year. As for the third year, this project aimed to aid in climate change research and adaptation planning by providing an information database essential to the future development of Yukon climate change scenarios"
