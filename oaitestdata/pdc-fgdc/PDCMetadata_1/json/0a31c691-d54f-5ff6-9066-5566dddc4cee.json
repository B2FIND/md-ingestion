        "The primary emphasis of the GWAMM research is the development of a Community-Based Monitoring (CBM) network within the greater Hudson Bay region of the Canadian Arctic. This network operates by working with northerners to collect marine mammal tissue samples from subsistence hunts and ecosystem prey and components from dedicated monitors. Biological samples and information are being gathered to develop a long-term data set of marine mammal health and ecology in the region to determine how climate warming may affect marine mammals and Nunavummiut communities that depend on them in the future. We are quantifying changes in diet, reproductive success, condition, survival, and ultimately model how endemic species will respond to new marine mammal species invading their traditional environment."

Other sample information collected includes: species, sex, date and time of harvest, location, GPS coordinates, habitat, total length, axillary girth, hips girth, fat depth, body weight, and sculp weight. These samples were collected from 53 ringed seals and 5 bearded seals in October 2009. Research scientists also collected further biological samples from a smaller sub-set of 15 ringed seals: whiskers, claw, hair, heart, lung, trachea, adrenal glands, inguinal lymph nodes,  and tyroid glands all frozen at -25C.
