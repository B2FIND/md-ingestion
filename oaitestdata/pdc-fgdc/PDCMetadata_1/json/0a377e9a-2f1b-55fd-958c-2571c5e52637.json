        "O-buoys enable remote and long-term chemical measurements in hostile polar environments, generating important knowledge and understanding for decision makers and Northerners who are adapting to their changing environment. The O-buoy network will provide the long-term observations required not only to improve understanding of the fundamental chemical and physical processes but to better understand how atmosphere-surface interactive processes respond to the changes across the Arctic. The overall project goal is to advance knowledge of the present state of the global atmospheric CO2 level and future behaviour of the global carbon cycle."

A prototype O-buoy was operating in the Elson Lagoon near Barrow Alaska to determine performance characteristics.  The prototype was deployed in the frozen Beaufort Sea in 2009 and 2 more units in 2010 and 2011. One unit under name O-buoy 3 collected information over the ice of the Hudson Bay (near Churchill, MB) in February and March 2010 and 2011. O-buoy 4 recorded data over the ice of the Arctic Ocean south of Borden Island in April 2010 and was redeployed in the North Pole area in 2011. More units will be deployed in the future in various parts of the Arctic and sub-Arctic. Research Program(s): IPY.
