Twenty trees of each species were sampled, with two cores extracted from each tree (80 cores total from each site).  Samples will be measured and cross-dated in the lab, and master chronologies will be created for each species using standard dendrochronological procedures.  Statistical procedures will isolate the climatic factor(s) influencing each tree-species growth, and this information will be used to evaluate each species and its individual radial growth-climate relationship.  Dataset variables, with brief description of each variable:  Sample #: Black spruce: 07CJL101 to 07CJL120. Balsam fir: 07CJL301 to 07CJL320.  Grid zone: 21 U.  GPS UTM: Easting 0312218, Northing 6096595.  Elevation (m asl): 28 m.  Notes: Two dominant species were black spruce (Picea mariana) and balsam fir (Abies balsamea).  A set was bored for these two species on a flat mossy floor.
