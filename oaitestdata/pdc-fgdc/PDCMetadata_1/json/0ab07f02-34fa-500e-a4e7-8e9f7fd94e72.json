Samples will be measured and cross-dated in the lab, and master chronologies will be created for each species using standard dendrochronological procedures.  Statistical procedures will isolate the climatic factor(s) influencing each tree-species growth, and this information will be used to evaluate each species and its individual radial growth-climate relationship.
