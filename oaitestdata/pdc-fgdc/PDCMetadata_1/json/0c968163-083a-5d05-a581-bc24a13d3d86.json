        "Ample evidence shows that dissolved organic carbon (DOC) would be the major or even the only direct contributor to the respired carbon fluxes in temperate forest, peatland, even permafrost peatland. And DOC pool is composed by different DOC fractions with a continuum of biodegradability ranging from labile fractions to recalcitrant fractions. The goal of this research was to provide the litter continuous-recalcitrance (decomposition status) DOC production/mineralization functions for each litter type in permafrost peatland for my model to simulate DOC production /mineralization along peat profile. This study will also provide a constant anaerobic moisture modifier for DOC production/mineralization, test and modify the unsaturated moisture modifier that is used in the Holocene Peat Model (HPM), and modify decomposition temperature dependency that is used in the McGill Wetland Model."
