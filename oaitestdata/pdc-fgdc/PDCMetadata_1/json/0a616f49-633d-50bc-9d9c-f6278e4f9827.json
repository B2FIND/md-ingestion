The effects of the changing climate compound other pressures and stresses that communities in which they will need to adapt. The purpose of the project was to: (1) examine what roles and values and cultural identity play in shaping responses to climate change in Labrador and; (2) provide in-depth knowledge of how values and culture are likely elements that will impact adaptation measures in Labrador communities."
