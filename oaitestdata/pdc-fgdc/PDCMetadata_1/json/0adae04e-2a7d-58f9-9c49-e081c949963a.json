        "The RADARSAT satellite image collections in the Polar Data Catalogue include imagery from both RADARSAT-1 and RADARSAT-2.   &gt;&gt;During its operation (1995-2013), the RADARSAT-1 satellite and sensors collected Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, including a significant portion which is attributable to the systematic data collection effort of the Background Mission. The archive of imagery developed during the Background Mission has emphasized, among other things, the RADARSAT imaging capabilities during times of inclement weather and low illumination conditions.  Practical experience by operational users has demonstrated that RADARSAT imagery is an excellent and reliable source for mapping and monitoring sea ice and other cryospheric features in northern latitudes during different times of the year. RADARSAT-1 has collected an incredible wealth of SAR imagery over polar regions, including northern Canada. A large portion of this archive is available on the Polar Data Catalogue as the RADARSAT Polar Science Dataset.     &gt;&gt;The RADARSAT-2 Antarctic Mapping Initiative was undertaken to produce a continental mosaic consistent with the 1997 RADARSAT-1 Antarctic Mapping Mission. The resulting mosaics and individual tiles, produced in collaboration with the Byrd Polar Research Center, cover all the way to the South Pole, permitted by the left-looking capabilities of the RADARSAT-2. This is only the second time pole-to-coast mosaic SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) coverage has been achieved, the first time having been the RADARSAT-1 Antarctic Mapping Mission in 1997. In addition to enhancing the achievements of previous RADARSAT-1 Antarctic missions, the intent of this mission was to facilitate change analysis through space-borne observation of ice sheets. Such data are important for generation of global climate products, including models. The mission was the result of international collaboration associated with the International Polar Year (IPY), incorporating input from the scientific community, with the goal of making science products available for free. This dataset is a Canadian Space Agency contribution to IPY."
