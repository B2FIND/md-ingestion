        "Trace elements are chemicals that occur at very low concentrations, but play a role in the carbon cycle, marine ecosystems, and contaminant and climate processes of the oceans. This project is looking at the distribution and processes relating to trace elements in the Arctic Ocean. Specifically, how trace elements interact with changes in temperature, sea-ice cover, fresh water discharge, marine ecosystem structure and carbon sequestration capacity of the Arctic Ocean are being studied."
