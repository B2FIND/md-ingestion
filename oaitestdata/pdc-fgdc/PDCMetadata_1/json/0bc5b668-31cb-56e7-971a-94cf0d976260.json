Each 6 m x 6 m transect plot was divided into four quadrants (3 m x 3 m), a 0.6 m x 0.6 m quadrat was placed at the center of each quadrant. A line quantum PAR sensor (Apogee Inc.) was handheld horizontally above the quadrats at a height of 0.5 m to take the down-welling (i.e., incident solar PAR) and up-welling PAR (i.e., reflected PAR from the canopy). In order to ensure the fPAR variation within each quadrat was characterized, the up-welling PAR was measured at five different places within each quadrat. For each permanent plot, quantum sensors were installed on brackets: one looking upward to record the down-welling/incident PAR measurements and one looking downward to record the up-welling/reflected PAR measurements at a time interval of 5 minutes.
