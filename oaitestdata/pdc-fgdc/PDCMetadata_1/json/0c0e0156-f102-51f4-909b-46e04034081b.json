        "Arctic and Sub-Arctic soils contain a large amount of organic carbon in their topsoil horizons and in the upper layers of permafrost. There is concern that climate warming could release this soil organic carbon (SOC) to the atmosphere as greenhouse gases. However, information about the profile features of the soil (SOC concentrations based on horizons and depths) and spatial distribution of SOC in northern ecosystems are far less than for other regions. This study compiled available field measurements of SOC in northern Canada. This project is funded by 1) a joint program between Environment Canada and Natural Resources Canada for estimation of greenhouse gases emissions and removals from land use changes over Canada\u2019s arctic and sub-arctic; 2) Climate Change Geoscience Program (CCGP), Natural Resources Canada; 3) Canadian Space Agency\u2019s Government Related Initiatives Program (GRIP); and 4) Polar Knowledge Canada Science and Technology (POLAR S&amp;T) program."
