          <abstract>GraphML files for undirected weighted graphs with nodes that represent protein sequences of expansin homologues. Protein sequences were clustered by a threshold of sequence identity to derive representative sequences.Pairwise sequence identity between two sequences was derived from global Needleman-Wunsch alignment. Protein sequence networks were generated with edge weights of pairwise sequence identity, filtered by a predefined threshold. Metadata of the nodes (e.g. annotations) and of the edges (the edge weights) were summarized in GraphML files.</abstract>
          <notes>The GraphML attributes for the edges comprise the edge weights (pairwise sequence identity, "weight").&#13;
The GraphML attributes for the nodes comprise the identifiers from the ExED ("sequence_id", "protein_id", "hfam_id", and "sfam_id" for sequence, protein, homologous family and superfamily identifiers, respectively), the NCBI taxonomy ID ("tax_id"), the annotated (organism) source name ("tax_name"), the taxonomic lineage of the source organism ("lineage", with taxa separated by "&amp;lt;--"), and the length of the amino acid sequence ("sequence_length"). In addition, suggested color names are given for both fill color and border color of each node ("color" and "color_border").</notes>
