Isar in Southern Germany. The airborne hyperspectral data is complemented by accompanying in-situ data acquired parallel to the overflights. The dataset is composed of a) four airborne hyperspectral image mosaics acquired during overflights on April 28th 2012, May 25th 2012, June 16th 2012 and September 8th 2012 with the AVIS-3 imaging spectrometer.

The HySpex data consists of 332 spectral bands, ranging from VIS to SWIR (417 - 2496 nm); c) spatially comprehensive land use/land cover maps generated from in-situ observations for two time-windows during the growing season of 2012 (May and August); d) Flight-parallel in-situ point-measurements consisting of: i) non-destructively measured leaf area index of winter wheat, winter barley, sugar beet, maize and rapeseed (561 measurements incl. standard deviations), ii) SPAD chlorophyll measurements (522 measurements incl. standard deviations), iii) 557 soil moisture measurements incl. standard deviations iv) 539 phenological observations v) 499 measurements of canopy height incl. standard deviations and vi) 38 measurements of plant density. The dataset was collected in order to cover the seasonal dynamics in the development of agricultural crops in Southern Germany.;The Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) is a German hyperspectral satellite mission that aims at monitoring and characterizing the Earth\u2019s environment on a global scale. EnMAP serves to measure and model key dynamic processes of the Earth\u2019s ecosystems by extracting geochemical, biochemical and biophysical parameters, which provide information on the status and evolution of various terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. In the frame of the EnMAP preparatory phase, pre-flight campaigns including airborne and in-situ measurements in different environments and for several application fields are being conducted. The main purpose of these campaigns is to support the development of scientific applications for EnMAP. In addition, the acquired data are input in the EnMAP end-to-end simulation tool (EeteS) and are employed to test data pre-processing and calibration-validation methods.
