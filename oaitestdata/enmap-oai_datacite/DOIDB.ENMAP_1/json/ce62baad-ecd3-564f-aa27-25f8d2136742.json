The airborne data consists of 288 spectral bands, ranging from VIS to SWIR (413 - 2449 nm). A mosaic of the three image strips covering the Neusling test area is also provided; b) spectral reference and control measurements acquired with a portable ASD FieldSpec 3 JR spectroradiometer in 2150 spectral bands (350 - 2500nm) taken parallel to the overflight; c) a spatially comprehensive land use/land cover map generated from in-situ observations during the days next to the overflight; d) Flight-parallel in-situ point-measurements consisting of: i) non-destructively measured leaf area index of sugar beet, maize, grassland and legumes (105 measurements incl. standard deviations), ii) SPAD chlorophyll measurements (106 measurements incl. standard deviations), iii) 106 measurements of canopy height (incl. standard deviations). The dataset was collected with an agricultural focus.;The Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) is a German hyperspectral satellite mission that aims at monitoring and characterizing the Earth\u2019s environment on a global scale. EnMAP serves to measure and model key dynamic processes of the Earth\u2019s ecosystems by extracting geochemical, biochemical and biophysical parameters, which provide information on the status and evolution of various terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. In the frame of the EnMAP preparatory phase, pre-flight campaigns including airborne and in-situ measurements in different environments and for several application fields are being conducted. The main purpose of these campaigns is to support the development of scientific applications for EnMAP.
