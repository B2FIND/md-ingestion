Protein sequences were clustered by a threshold of sequence identity to derive representative sequences.Pairwise sequence identity between two sequences was derived from global Needleman-Wunsch alignment. Protein sequence networks were generated with edge weights of pairwise sequence identity, filtered by a predefined threshold. Metadata of the nodes (e.g. annotations) and of the edges (the edge weights) were summarized in GraphML files.;The GraphML attributes for the edges comprise the edge weights (pairwise sequence identity, \"weight\").\r\nThe GraphML attributes for the nodes comprise the identifiers from the ExED (\"sequence_id\", \"protein_id\", \"hfam_id\", and \"sfam_id\" for sequence, protein, homologous family and superfamily identifiers, respectively), the NCBI taxonomy ID (\"tax_id\"), the annotated (organism) source name (\"tax_name\"), the taxonomic lineage of the source organism (\"lineage\", with taxa separated by \"&lt;--\"), and the length of the amino acid sequence (\"sequence_length\"). In addition, suggested color names are given for both fill color and border color of each node (\"color\" and \"color_border\").",
