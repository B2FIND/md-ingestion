Reactions were stopped by shock freezing in liquid nitrogen, then treated with proteinase K for 2 hours. Afterwards, the DNA was digested with the BsaI-HFv2 enzyme and a hairpin was ligated using T4 DNA ligase (NEB). The DNA was bisulfite converted using EZ DNA Methylation-Lightning kit (ZYMO RESEARCH) according to the manufacturer protocol, purified and eluted with 10 \u00b5L ddH2O. Libraries for Illumina Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) were produced with the two-step PCR approach. In the first PCR, 2 \u00b5L of bisulfite-converted DNA were amplified with the HotStartTaq DNA Polymerase (QIAGEN) and primers containing internal barcodes using following conditions: 15 min at 95 \u00b0C, 10 cycles of 30 sec at 94 \u00b0C, 30 sec at 50 \u00b0C, 1 min and 30 sec at 72 \u00b0C, and final 5 min at 72 \u00b0C; using a mixture containing 1x PCR Buffer, 1x Q-Solution, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.05 U/\u00b5L HotStartTaq DNA Polymerase, 0.4 \u00b5M forward and 0.4 \u00b5M reverse primers in a total volume of 20 \u00b5L. In the second PCR, 1 \u00b5L of obtained products were amplified by Phusion Polymerase (Thermo) with another set of primers to introduce adapters and indices needed for NGS (30 sec at 98 \u00b0C, 10 cycles - 10 sec at 98 \u00b0C, 40 sec at 72 \u00b0C, and 5 min at 72 \u00b0C). PCRII was carried out in 1x Phusion HF Buffer, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.02 U/\u00b5L Phusion HF DNA Polymerase, 0.4 \u00b5M forward and 0.4 \u00b5M reverse primers in a total volume of 20 \u00b5L. Obtained libraries were pooled in equimolar amounts and purified using NucleoSpin\u00ae Gel and PCR Clean-up kit (Macherey-Nagel), followed by a second purification step of gel extraction and size exclusion with AMPure XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter). Sequencing was performed at the Max Planck Genome Centre Cologne.;Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft;JE 252/36",
