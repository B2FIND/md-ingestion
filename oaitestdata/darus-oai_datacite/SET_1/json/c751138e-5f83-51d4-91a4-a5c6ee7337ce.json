It was built by a team of PhD students within one week of interdisciplinary work during the 2019 summer school at the University of Auckland.\r\nThe setup consists of a 6-axis robot (UR5 of Universal Robots), which has a flexible pen with integrated flex sensors as end effector. A balloon is attached to a fixture in front of the robot which is equipped with a load cell for z-axis force measurement. For the human-machine interface, a haptic device is used. The control for these components is implemented as a distributed control architecture using several PCs and microcontrollers.\r\nThe robot control is controlled by teleoperation. The forces measured at the end effector are feed back to the operator through the haptic decive. For more information on the utilized teleoperation framework refer to the paper of Gorjup et al. which is listed as related publication.;University of Auckland;Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft;GRK 2198/1;University of Auckland;Vice-Chancellor\u2019s Strategic Development Fund;Auckland Bioengineering Institute of the University of Auckland;Faculty Research Development Fund",
