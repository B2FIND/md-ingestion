The profile HMMs for the N- and C-terminal expansin domain were built by HMMER from multiple sequence alignments (structure-guided).\r\nBased on the alignment and on annotations of secondary structures in the Pfam database (entries PF03330.17 for the N-terminal domain and PF01357.20 for the C-terminal domain), the respective domains were manually retrieved.",
