Previous studies of denudation rates from cosmogenic 10Be and 26Al concentrations are limited to single drainages. In this study, we present 34 new 10Be and eight 26Al derived catchment-averaged denudation rates from 33 catchments to analyze variations of denudation rates between 18\u00b0S to 23\u00b0S in the Coastal and Western Cordilleras of northern Chile.

The controls on the denudation rates are evaluated using a statistical factor analysis of ten selected catchment parameters. Denudation rates indicate a strong linear relationship with channel steepness indices but insignificant correlations and covariation with mean annual precipitation rates, drainage area, stream order, mean elevation, mean local relief, mean basin slope and analyzed grain size. Thus, denudation rates are better correlated with tectonic controls at catchment scale than orogen-scale plate tectonics in the Western Cordillera and Coastal Cordillera. ;-23.885837699861995 -70.48828125 -18.35452552912664 -67.9833984375",
