For each of these profiles, the PBL height is estimated as the base altitude of the first elevated temperature inversion (i.e. the altitude level above which temperature starts to increase with altitude). An upper limit of 4 km is fixed for the PBL height. In order to reduce uncertainties associated with data gaps, we discarded (i) all profiles with more than 25% of missing temperature data between 0 and 4 km (i.e. cumulated data gaps larger than 0.25x4000=2000 m), and/or (ii) all profiles with more than 4 missing data between the surface and the estimated PBL height (i.e. cumulated data gaps larger than 4x50=200 m). \n3) The profiles are expressed in the z/h vertical coordinate system where z is the altitude and h the PBL height estimate. O3 and CO mixing ratios are interpolated along z/h values ranging between 0 (the surface) and 2 (two times the PBL height) with a vertical resolution of of 0.05 (i.e. 40 altitude levels).
