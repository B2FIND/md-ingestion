      <dct:abstract>AnaEE-France is the French national infrastructure devoted to the study of continental ecosystems and their biodiversity. It offers experimental facilities in controlled, semi-natural or natural environments, analysis platforms and shared instruments as well as modeling platforms and database Information Systems.
Modeling platforms are facilities specialized in developing models to support the projects run by AnaEE.  They streamline model development by providing the necessary hardware and software, as well as the access to expertise, datasets and modelling libraries. Two types of platforms are or will be provided: i) model factories which are nationally supported software platforms with advanced and well-established facilities providing users access to general and extensible modeling resources and ii) Modeling solution platforms which are implemented as self-contained software solutions that model specific aspects of ecosystem function and are centered on a well-established and supported model development team with a strong community of users.
Both types are used to exploit mathematical models to test and develop our understanding of the complex quantitative relationships between processes within ecosystems, the interactions with their environments, and their functioning and behaviour under various pressures.

Database Information systems have been developed for the management of the data produced by the AnaEE-F experimental facilities. These IS rely on two main architectural models : databases for long term experiments (in natura) and databases for short to middle term experiments (mostly in ecotrons and mesocosms)

Based on a distributed architecture, the overall AnaEE-F IS develops a semantic interoperability of modeling platforms and database IS and provides portals for the discovery and the exploitation of these resources.</dct:abstract>
