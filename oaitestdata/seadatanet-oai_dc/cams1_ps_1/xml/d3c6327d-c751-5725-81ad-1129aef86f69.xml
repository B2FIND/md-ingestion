      <dct:abstract>The data collection of the North Sea is divided in two datasets : the discrete collection and the trajectories collection.

The Discrete SeaDataCloud Temperature and Salinity Historical Data Collection for the North Sea includes open access in situ data on temperature and salinity measured with &#8220;discrete&#8221; instruments (CTD, XBT, discrete water samplers&#8230;). The data span between 4&#176;W and 10&#176;E in longitude, and from 49&#176;N to 62&#176;N in latitude. It covers the time period 1893 &#8211; 2017. The data were retrieved from the SeaDataNet infrastructure in November 2017. 
The &#8220;Trajectories&#8221; SeaDataCloud Temperature and Salinity Historical Data Collection for the North Sea includes open access in situ data on temperature and salinity measured by continuously recording sensors (e.g. Ferryboxes). The data span between 4&#176;W and 10&#176;E in longitude, and from 49&#176;N to 62&#176;N in latitude. It covers the time period 1989 &#8211; 2017. 

The data were retrieved from the SeaDataNet infrastructure in November 2017. The quality control of the data has been performed with the help of ODV software. Data Quality Flags have been revised following common recommended procedures defined under SeaDataNet 2 project in conjunction with visual expert check. 

The dataset format is ODV binary collections. You can read, analyse and export from the ODV application provided by Alfred Wegener institute at http://odv.awi.de/.
