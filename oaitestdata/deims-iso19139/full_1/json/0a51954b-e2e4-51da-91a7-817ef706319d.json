The Coneyglen Burn lies in the Sperrin Mountains of central Northern Ireland. The catchment area is 1264 ha and rises from 230 m at the sampling station to a maximum of 562 m at Carnanelly. The underlying geology is schists of the Mullaghcarn series, which occur in places as rocky outcrops. Catchment soils are dominated by blanket peats and peaty podsols. Adjacent to the stream the thin peat is interspersed with alluvium, sands and gravels. Originally some 4% of the catchment (the lower section) was planted with conifers but this has increased slightly since 2000 as the forested area was enlarged. Previously improved grazing land in the middle section of the catchment, adjacent to a small farm, is no longer actively managed, except by grazing, and is reverting to moorland, with a predominance of Juncus species. Old field systems and drainage patterns suggest a higher intensity of land-use in the past. Elsewhere, the vegetation is characterised by moorland species, notably Calluna. Contemporary land-use and management is confined to low-intensity sheep grazing and infrequent heather burning. The annual rainfall is c.1500 mm.
