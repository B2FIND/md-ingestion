The Riga Hydroelectric Power Plant was put into operation in 1974. In order to build Riga HES, a dam was constructed across the Daugava River through the middle of Doles Sala, half of which has since been flooded to make room for Riga Reservoir. Along with Doles Sala, there have been several other smaller islands drowned in order to fill the reservoir. The dam was built in the late 1970s.;24.410247802734;24.266052246094;56.821350720626;56.863413067939;16.00;18;urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG;MSL height;Not specific to any location or epoch.;Hydrography.;Representative area of sampling: single point;ground condition;1976-01-01;2015-12-31;http://doi.org/10.23728/b2share.4bb6bc9e5f894d8ea97912ab0639e5ca;WWW:LINK-1.0-http--link;DOI;UKST;dataset;Conformity_001;INSPIRE;COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 1089/2010 of 23 November 2010 implementing Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards interoperability of spatial data sets and services;2010-12-08;publication;See the referenced specification;Method description: precipitation gauge, since 2002 Milos-500 weather station.
