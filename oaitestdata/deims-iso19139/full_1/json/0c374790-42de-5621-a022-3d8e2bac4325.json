On 42 ha of experimental fields (sandy loam; average soil quality [\u201cAckerzahl\u201d] 35-45), different agricultural cultivation systems can be realised with modern experimental technology. On site, there are various technical measuring systems such as the TERENO lysimeters and the large gas chambers of &quot;CARBO-ZALF-D\u201c. Dedelow is part of the ZALF Landscape Laboratory &quot;AgroScapeLab Quillow&quot; and supports numerous projects (e.g. DFG Research Training Group BioMove) regarding the planning and implementation of measurement programs in cooperation with farmers.;13.803000000000;13.803000000000;53.366500000000;53.366500000000;Representative area of sampling: _unknown;ground condition;2007-01-01;2007-12-31;http://doi.org/10.4228/ZALF.2007.250;WWW:LINK-1.0-http--link;DOI;WWW:DOWNLOAD-1.0-http--download;dataset;Conformity_001;INSPIRE;COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 1089/2010 of 23 November 2010 implementing Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards interoperability of spatial data sets and services;2010-12-08;publication;See the referenced specification;Method description: The data were obtained by an automatic measurement device, which is following the standards of the German Wheather Service (DWD).
