This site at Thorverton weir on the River Exe drains the Exmoor National Park and is situated above the City of Exeter and the more industrialised sub-catchment of the River Culm. Most of the catchment is populated by isolated farmsteads, hamlets, villages and small towns. The only major urban area upstream of this site is Tiverton. The River Exe rises at a level of 450 m AOD in the wet moorland of Exmoor, then passes through steep-sided valleys with extensive broad-leaved woodland. Further east, tributaries run off the Brendon Hills with the River Haddeo drained to form the major water resource of Wimbleball Reservoir. Further south of these tributaries down towards Tiverton the floodplain opens out and rolling farmland replaces woodland. The farmland in the catchment of Thorverton weir includes sheep, cattle and dairy farming. All stretches of river above Thorverton weir, except the Riverton canal, fit into the Environment Agency's River Objective classes 1 and 2 which describe water of very good, or good quality suitable for all fish species. The majority of the Thorverton weir catchment fits into the Environment Agency's Biological Classification class A. The average rainfall for the Exe catchment as a whole 1097 mm, with a maximum of 2018 mm on Exmoor. Analysis of the flow record at Thorverton shows a mean daily flow of 15.887 cumecs with a Q95 that is 12% of the mean daily flow which indicates a relatively 'flashy' flow regime compared to the rest of England.;The original metadata record was created using DEIMS-SDR, the Dynamic Ecological Information Management System - Site and dataset registry;Andrew Sier;Centre for Ecology & Hydrology;arjs@ceh.ac.uk;Centre for Ecology & Hydrology Lancaster Lancashire LA1 4AP GB;Centre for Ecology & Hydrology;Ben Bradford;LTER Europe;bradfb@environment-agency.gov.uk;Andrew Sier;Centre for Ecology & Hydrology;arjs@ceh.ac.uk;Centre for Ecology & Hydrology Lancaster Lancashire LA1 4AP GB;site;emf2iso_pointer_record;ecosystem parameter;nitrogen content;ammonium content;dissolved nutrient;inorganic nutrient content;total organic carbon;water parameter;water acidity;water alkalinity;chlorophyll content of water;conductivity;dissolved organic carbon in water;water transparency;water level;stage height;water quality;suspended solids;water temperature;Fresh water rivers;continuousDataCollection;Environmental monitoring facilities;GEMET - INSPIRE themes, version 1.0;2008-06-01;English;environment;-3.500000000000;-3.500000000000;50.800000000000;50.800000000000;1994-01-01;https://deims.org/b8e9402a-10bc-4892-b03d-1e85fc925c99;http://data.ecn.ac.uk/sites/ecnsites.asp?site=R04;http://data.ecn.ac.uk/;https://data.lter-europe.net/geoserver/deims/ows?service=WFS&version=2.0.0&request=GetFeature&typeName=deims:lter_all_formal&CQL_FILTER=uuid='b8e9402a-10bc-4892-b03d-1e85fc925c99'&outputFormat=SHAPE-ZIP;WFS GetFeature request for downloading the data set in SHP format;https://data.lter-europe.net/geoserver/deims/ows?service=WFS&version=2.0.0&request=GetFeature&typeName=deims:lter_all_formal&CQL_FILTER=uuid='b8e9402a-10bc-4892-b03d-1e85fc925c99'&outputFormat=application%2Fgml%2Bxml%3B+version%3D3.2;WFS GetFeature request for downloading the data set in GML 3.2 format;https://data.lter-europe.net/geoserver/deims/ows?service=WFS&version=2.0.0&request=GetFeature&typeName=deims:lter_all_formal&CQL_FILTER=uuid='b8e9402a-10bc-4892-b03d-1e85fc925c99'&outputFormat=application%2Fjson;WFS GetFeature request for downloading the data set in GeoJSON format;https://data.lter-europe.net/pycsw?service=CSW&version=3.0.0&request=GetRecordById&ElementSetName=full&outputSchema=http://www.isotc211.org/2005/gmd&outputFormat=application/json&id=f9a3608c-ffc9-48c9-86e8-bf89182565b1;HTTP;Catalogue Service for the Web (CSW);https://deims.org/node/240;United Kingdom (ECN);COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 1089/2010 of 23 November 2010 implementing Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards interoperability of spatial data sets and services;2010-12-08;publication;This data set is conformant with the INSPIRE Implementing Rules for the interoperability of spatial data sets and services;false;Dataset has been created by data transformation from the original record collected by the site managers using DEIMS site metadata editing form.",
