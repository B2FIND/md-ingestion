Samples were collected at the following depths for each year: 1971-april 1973 and 1975: 0, -5 m, -10 m, -15 m, bottom; june 1973-1974: 0, -2 m, -5 m, -10 m, -15 m, -18 m, bottom. Winkler reagents were immediately added to samples, which were then kept refrigerated and transported to the laboratory for analysis according to the Winkler method. Sampling frequency differed among years: 1971: monthly from july to october; 1972: monthly (occasionally twice a month) from may to october; 1973: irregular frequency from january to november (ranging from monthly to three times a month); 1974: monthly from january to october (excluding june); 1975: monthly from june to october (excluding august).).
