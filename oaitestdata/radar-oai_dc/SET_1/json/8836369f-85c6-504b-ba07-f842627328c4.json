Of the 92 institutions surveyed, 68 took part in the survey (73%), of which 43 completed the survey in full (47%). Only the latter results were taken into account for the evaluation. The participants of the survey come from all 5 sections, with the most participants from section A (35%) and the least from section E (9%). All respondents stated that they organize or host at least 1-2 events per year, while 35% organize or host 3-5 events and a relative majority of 42% organizes or hosts more than 5 events a year. There are talks at all events and a vast majority of 86% stated that there are on average up to 30 talks at each of their events.  42% of the respondents stated that they already recorded events in the past, while 54% did not. However, the comments showed that most institutes had only very occasionally produced recordings and in some cases only audio recordings. Therefore, an enormous majority of 77% stated that they were interested in a Leibniz conference recording service with only 14% stating that they were not interested. The remaining 9% did not answer the question or commented that their interest would depend on the exact conditions of the service.  We conclude from this survey that there is a very great potential and an enormous demand for LeiCord within the Leibniz Association. We estimate from the results that all Leibniz institutes together host and organize about 350-500 events annually with a total of about seven to ten thousand talks. With more than three quarters of the respondents being interested in a conference recording service this represents an enormous treasure trove of scientific communication that can be opened to a larger audience. ;Umfrage, wissenschaftliche Konferenz, Videoaufzeichnung, Marktanalyse, Survey, Scientific Conference, Video Recordings, Needs Assessment;deu;application/zip",
