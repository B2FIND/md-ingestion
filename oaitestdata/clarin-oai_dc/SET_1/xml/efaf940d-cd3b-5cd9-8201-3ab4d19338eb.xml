1. These Assamese NLP resources including the Tools and Applications are developed&#13;
during Research and Development Projects as well as Masters and Ph.D. thesis&#13;
works.&#13;
2. These are mainly developed or generated at Gauhati University Department of&#13;
Computer Science and Department of Information Technology.&#13;
3. These resources are used by students and researchers for further studies, researches, as&#13;
well as for design and development of tools and applications.&#13;
4. Computational Linguistics in Assamese is not rich, and Natural Language Processing&#13;
works have mainly started during last two decades, and most of the resources are first&#13;
generation resources, and with ample scope for upgrading, enriching, and purifying.&#13;
5. These are very good and essential resources for all the researchers in Assamese NLP, as&#13;
the language requires more and more NLP works to make Assamese a rich media for&#13;
the digital world.&#13;
6. Anyone interested, or in need of such resources may express their interest for the&#13;
required resources, and the way of availability will be advised/informed accordingly.&#13;
7. These are purely research materials and could only be used for further research only.&#13;
8. Researchers may visit the NLP Lab of Department of Information Technology, Gauhati&#13;
University, Guwahati, India or contact us.&#13;
