      <dc:description>The LogicalFormBankPT (Branco, 2009, and Branco et al., 2011) is a corpus of semantic dependencies of translated texts composed of 3,406 sentences and 44,598 tokens taken from the Wall Street Journal.

The LogicalFormBankPT is composed of MRS representations of each sentence&#226;&#128;&#153;s semantic relations resulting from a previous semi-automatic analysis with a double-blind annotation followed by adjudication (see Branco and Costa, 2008, with a full description of the process). The resulting dataset contains one information level: semantic relations.

The main motivation behind the creation of this resource was to build a high quality data set with syntactic information that could support the development of a large set of automatic resources and tools for Portuguese for NLP studies.

The development of this resource started under the METANET4U project (at: http://metanet4u.eu/) whose main goal is to contribute to the establishment of a pan-European digital platform that makes available language resources and services, encompassing both datasets and software tools, for speech and language processing, and supports a new generation of exchange facilities for them.
