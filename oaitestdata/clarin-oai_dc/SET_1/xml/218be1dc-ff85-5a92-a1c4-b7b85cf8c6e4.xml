      <dc:description>The TreeBankPT (Branco et al., 2011) is a corpus of syntactic constituency trees of the translated news composed of 3,406 sentences and 44,598 tokens taken from the Wall Street Journal.
For the creation of this TreeBank we adopted a semi-automatic analysis with a double-blind annotation followed by adjudication. The resulting dataset contains one information level: phrase constituency.
The main motivation behind the creation of this resource was to build a high quality data set with syntactic information that could support the development of a large set of automatic resources and tools for Portuguese for NLP studies.
The development of this resource started under the METANET4U project (at: http://metanet4u.eu/) whose main goal is to contribute to the establishment of a pan-European digital platform that makes available language resources and services, encompassing both datasets and software tools, for speech and language processing, and supports a new generation of exchange facilities for them.
