The recordings were done by means of a cassette recorder (Sony TC-D5M) and Sony&#13;
lavaliere microphones. They were digitized in the 1990s. The recordings were made in the&#13;
speakers&#8217; homes.&#13;
&#13;
The speakers&#13;
The set consists of three speakers, two women from the village of Nusn&#228;s, born in 1925 and&#13;
1966, grandmother and grandchild. The third speaker is a man from the village of Gars&#229;s,&#13;
some kilometers further south, born in 1928. They were recruited with the help of the&#13;
Swedish linguist Gunnar Nystr&#246;m, who has a thorough knowledge of Dalarna and the Dalarna&#13;
dialects. The youngest speaker did not grow up in East Mora, but in the city of Falun. Both&#13;
parents were from East Mora, however, and the dialect was her home language. She also&#13;
spent her summer holidays at her grandmother&#8217;s home in Nusn&#228;s.&#13;
