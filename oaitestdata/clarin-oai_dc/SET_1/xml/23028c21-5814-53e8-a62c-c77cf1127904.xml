      <dc:title>CINTIL-QATreeBank</dc:title>
      <dc:description>CINTIL-QATreebank is a treebank composed of Portuguese sentences that can be used to support the development of Question Answering systems. This Treebank includes 111 declarative sentences from the pre-existing CINTIL-Treebank (see Branco et al. 2011) whose syntactic structure was manually transformed into their non-declarative counterpart: interrogative and imperative clauses.

The non-declarative sentences are annotated with several layers of linguistic information, namely (i) trees with information on constituency and grammatical function; (ii) sentence type; (iii) interrogative pronoun; (iv) question type; and (v) semantic type of expected answer. Moreover, these non-declarative sentences are paired with their declarative counterparts and associated with the expected answer snippets.
