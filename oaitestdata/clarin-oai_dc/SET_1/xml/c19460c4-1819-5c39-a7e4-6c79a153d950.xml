      <dc:title>UIMA/U-Compare Apertium POS Tagger </dc:title>
      <dc:description>This tool assigns a part-of-speech tag and base form to each token in a text. It operates on text that has previously been tokenised and morphologically analysed. The POS tagger is a module of Apertium machine translation system. The provided tool can currently operate on a subset of the languages that are supported by the Apertium system, namely:  English, Spanish, Calatan, Galician, Portuguese, Romanian and Basque. 
NOTE: The morphological analysis required prior to running the POS tagger MUST be carried out by running the Apertium morphological analyser (which also performs tokeniaation). 

The tool is provided as a UIMA component, specifically as Java archive (jar) file, which can be incorporated within any UIMA workflow. However, it is particularly designed use in the U-Compare text mining plaform (Kano et al., 2009; Kano et al., 2011; see separate META-SHARE record), since the types of annotations it produces are compliant with the U-Compare.
