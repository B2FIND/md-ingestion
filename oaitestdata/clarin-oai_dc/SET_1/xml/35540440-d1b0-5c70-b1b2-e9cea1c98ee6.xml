      <dc:description>This data is a sample from a collection of fragments of a Greek poet, Archilochus, which is based on text, translations and commentary edited by Anika Nicolosi (2013). This data is being produced in the context of a project that overviews the requirements for a scholarly digital edition of Archilochus.  This data includes a few fragments of the Greek poet which are used to build and test a prototype (HT-Archilochus), in view of developing a full digital edition (DEA-Digital Edition and Archilochus). &#13;
&#13;
This sample responds to the outcomes of a survey with several practitioners of Digital Classics and provides the learner with a set of resources and tools that ease a critical assessment of ancient text.&#13;
&#13;
The survey (Current practice with Digital Classics tools: use practice of digital resources and tools for studies on Digital Classics), supplementary to a master degree thesis discussed at the University of Parma, was performed from May to September 2016 on a sample of Italian digital humanists with focus of interest on ancient Greek philology and it is now available on-line,and still open for participation, at http://www.clarin-it.it/it/content/sondaggio-current-practice-digital-classics-tools.&#13;
&#13;
The survey is in line with the principles behind the recent user engagement strategy developed by CLARIN-ERIC (www.clarin.eu) and constitutes one of the national efforts undertaken by CLARIN-IT to contribute to the wider impact of CLARIN on Digital Classicists. News about the research&#8217;s results was given at Clarin Conference 2107 (18-21 September 2017, Budapest): A Survey on the Use and the Needs for Digital Resources and related Tools by Ancient Greek Scholars In Italy (Poster)&#13;
