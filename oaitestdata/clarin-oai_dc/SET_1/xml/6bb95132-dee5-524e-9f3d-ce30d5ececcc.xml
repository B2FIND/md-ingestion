      <dc:description>Recording equipment&#13;
The recordings were done by means of a cassette recorder (Sony TC-D5M) and Sony&#13;
lavaliere microphones. They were digitized in the 1990s.&#13;
The set consists of two speakers, father and grown-up daughter. The original full recordings&#13;
have been lost, and they are therefore reconstructed from a series of single files saved into one&#13;
wav file.&#13;
&#13;
The speakers&#13;
The two speakers, born in 1921 and 1944, were recruited with the help of the Swedish linguist&#13;
Gunnar Nystr&#246;m, who has a thorough knowledge of Dalarna and the Dalarna dialects. At the&#13;
time of recording, they lived in the villages of Karlsarvet and Brunnsberg. A third speaker&#13;
was also recorded, a man born in 1921, but due to his weak voice, extremely non-fluent&#13;
reading and background noise generated by some technical failure, this recording has not been&#13;
included in the collection.&#13;
