      <dc:description>Fully fledged automatic verbal conjugator for Portuguese, including all forms of clitic conjugation.It thus handles: * Pronominal conjugation The Portuguese verbal inflection system is a most complex part of the Portuguese morphology, and of the Portuguese language, given the high number of conjugated forms for each verb (ca. 70 forms in non pronominal conjugation), the number of productive inflection rules involved and the number of non regular forms and exceptions to such rules. This complexity is further increased when the so-called pronominal conjugation is taken into account. The Portuguese language has verbal clitics, which according to some authors are to be analyzed as integrating the inflectional suffix system: o the forms of the clitics may depend on the Number (Singular vs. Plural), the Person (First, Second, Third or Second courtesy), the Gender (Masculine vs. Feminine), the grammatical function which they are in correspondence with (Subject, Direct object or Indirect object), and the anaphoric properties (Pronominal vs. Reflexive); o up to three clitics (e.g. deu-se-lho / gave-One-ToHim_It) may be associated with a verb form; o clitics may occur in so called enclisis, i.e. as a final part of the verb form (e.g. deu-o / gave-It), or in mesoclisis, i.e. as a medial part of the verb form (e.g. d&#225;-lo-ia / give-it-CONDITIONAL). When the verb form occurs in certain syntactic or semantic contexts (e.g in the scope of negation), the clitics appear in proclisis, i.e. before the verb form (ex.: n&#227;o o deu / NOT it gave); o clitics follow specific rules for their concatenation. With LX-Conjugator, pronominal conjugation is exhaustively handled. It is however optional, and verbs can be conjugated also in non pronominal conjugation mode only. Additionally, LX-Conjugator exhaustively handles a set of inflection cases which tend not to be supported together in verbal conjugators: * Compound tenses * Double forms for past participles (regular and irregular) * Past participle forms inflected for number and gender (with transitive and unaccusative verbs) * Negative imperative forms * Courtesy forms for second person LX-Conjugator handles both known verbs and unknown verbs. It thus conjugates: * Neologisms (with orthographic infinitival suffix) It is also worth noting the following design principles, that LX-Conjugator adopts with respect to the so called defective verbs: * Defectives Some unsubstantiated assumptions from traditional grammar were not followed, according to which many verb forms do not exist and/or should not be used because they sound awkward or because their use is semantically very restricted. Accordingly, to give an example, all conjugated forms of weather verbs are delivered, as they can be used at least non literally (with forms other than third person singular ones being presented in a distinguished font to indicate that they have generally been considered non-existent). To give another example, verbs like falir are also fully conjugated (again with some of its forms marked in a disitinguished font in order to signal that some speakers may find them phonetically awkward). * Special cases LX-Conjugator does assume that some forms are impossible though (e.g. the imperative forms of verbs such as querer / to want: *quer tu) and that some clitics do not combine with certain verb forms (e.g. second person non-courtesy clitics and second person courtesy verb forms with the same number: *voc&#234; ama-te/you_COURTESY love-yourself_NONCOURTESY). In these cases such forms will not be produced. Other special cases, also not generated, include impersonal se and passive se, which do not occur with first or second person verb forms. LX-Conjugator handles the very few cases where there may be different forms in different variants: * Orthographic and paradigmatic differences When the same form has different orthographic representations, all such representations are presented. To give a couple of examples, both representations of '(he) dicharges', desagua (European) and des&#225;gua (Brazilian), and both representations for '(I) argued', argui (European) and arg&#252;i (Brazilian), are delivered. * Other cases Differences in irregular forms are also handled under the same approach. One such example is the past participle of 'to accept', with aceite (European) and aceito (Brazilian), which will be both displayed. Note that in general LX-Conjugator acknowledges differences in representations of the same verb form when such representations can be predicted from the representation of the infinitive form (to be entered by the user). Accordingly, representations of the same verb differing in (the non-final part of) their roots are not automatically acknowledged by the conjugator. For instance, all conjugated forms of 'to act' will start either with act- or with at-, depending on whether the user enters actuar (European) or atuar (Brazilian) as the representation of the infinitive.</dc:description>
