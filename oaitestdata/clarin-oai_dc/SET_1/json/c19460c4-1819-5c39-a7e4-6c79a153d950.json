It operates on text that has previously been tokenised and morphologically analysed. The POS tagger is a module of Apertium machine translation system. The provided tool can currently operate on a subset of the languages that are supported by the Apertium system, namely:  English, Spanish, Calatan, Galician, Portuguese, Romanian and Basque. \nNOTE: The morphological analysis required prior to running the POS tagger MUST be carried out by running the Apertium morphological analyser (which also performs tokeniaation). \n\nThe tool is provided as a UIMA component, specifically as Java archive (jar) file, which can be incorporated within any UIMA workflow. However, it is particularly designed use in the U-Compare text mining plaform (Kano et al., 2009; Kano et al., 2011; see separate META-SHARE record), since the types of annotations it produces are compliant with the U-Compare. \n;2013-02-15",
