It contains correspondences between surface form and lexical forms of words followed by standard grammatical properties. Compared to the first release, this version has a better JSON structure. The surface word forms have been generated algorithmically by using stable phonological and morphological rules of the Italian language. Particular attention has been given to the generation of verbs for which rules have been extracted from A.L e G. Lepschy, La Lingua Italiana.
