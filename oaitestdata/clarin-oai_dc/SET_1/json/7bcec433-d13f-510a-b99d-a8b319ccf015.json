This tool allows to get the value of similarity between unknown word and items from gazetteers (e.g. person first names, person last names, country names). NamEnSim can also extract multi-word named entities from the source text using similarity function. This tool supports named entities recognition task (NER), e.g. Liner2. In the named entities \"base - form\" matching task NamEnSim achieves the accuracy of 81-96% for the similarity function based on logistic regresion and 84-98% for the similarity function based on inflection rules (results depend on the named entity category).;2012-04-04;toolService;http://hdl.handle.net/11321/21;pol;downloadable_files_count: 0;Wroc\u0142aw University of Technology;http://nlp.pwr.wroc.pl/pl/narzedzia-i-zasoby/namensim",
