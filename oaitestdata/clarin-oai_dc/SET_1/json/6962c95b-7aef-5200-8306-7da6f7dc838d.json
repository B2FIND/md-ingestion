Its object was to produce an online resource that shows how Scots words have developed and been used from the early Middle Ages to the twentieth century. The resources are the \"Dictionary of the Older Scottish Tongue\" (DOST) and the \"Scottish National Dictionary\" (SND). DOST was compiled and published in paper between 1931 and 2002, and SND between 1931 and 1976. They are the most comprehensive dictionaries available for, respectively, older Scots and modern Scots, and are therefore essential research tools. The DSL project considerably increases access to these rich research resources, by making them freely available worldwide on the Internet.
