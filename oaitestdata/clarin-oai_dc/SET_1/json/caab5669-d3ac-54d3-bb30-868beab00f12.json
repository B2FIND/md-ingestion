The data set is made of nouns, adjectives, verbs and named entities, and has no multiwords.\nOriginally (Finkelstein, et al., 2002), each pair of words received a human judgement on a scale from 0 (totally unrelated words) to 10 (very much related or identical words).\nAgirre et al.

In an attempt to know which was the true relation between the words of each pair, they advanced with a different approach in the annotation of this data set. Thus, the annotators should classify all pairs as being synonyms, antonyms, identical, hyperonym-hyponym, sibling terms (terms with a common hyperonymy), meronym-holonym or none-of-the-above. With this annotation, they could determine which pairs had a relation of similarity among the two words and which pairs had related words. At the end, they distinguished between the pairs with related words and the pairs with similar words. In the word pairs categorized as synonyms, antonyms, identical and hyperonym-hyponym, there was a relation of similarity between both words. In the word pairs categorized as sibling terms, holonym-meronym or none-of-the-above, which had on average a similarity greater than 5, there was a relation of relatedness between both words.\nThe LX-WordSim-353 was the outcome of a) the translation of WordSim-353 into Portuguese and b) the annotation of that list with the classification established by Agirre, et al.
