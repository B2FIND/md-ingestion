The language of the text has to be specified as an input parameter so that the corresponding language model can be used. The package contains models for a wide range of languages (currently 57 --- covering all major languages). Furthermore, it provides a training script to learn models for additional languages using a set of user supplied sample html pages in the given language. The detection algorithm is based on determining similarity of byte trigrams vectors. In general, chared should be more accurate than other character encoding detection tools with no language constraints. This is an important advantage allowing precise character decoding needed for building large textual corpora. The tool has been used for building corpora in American Spanish, Arabic, Czech, French, Japanese, Russian, Tajik, and six Turkic languages consisting of 70 billions tokens altogether.
