It takes as input: * A Portuguese nominal form A forms of a noun or an adjective, including adjectival forms of past participles, and * Inflectional feature values Intended values of inflectional features of Gender and Number for the output. It delivers: * Inflectional features The input form is returned with the corresponding values for the inflectional features of Gender and Number associated to it; * Lemmata The lemmata (singular and masculine forms when available) possibly corresponding to the input form; * Inflected forms The inflected forms (when available) of each lemmata in accordance with the values for inflectional features entered. LX-Inflector processes simple forms, both lexically known and unknown ones. It also processes compound forms. It handles nominal forms with prefixes as well. In sum, it lemmatizes and inflects: * Prefixed forms Nominal expressions integrating one or more prefixes, e.g. \"anti-constitucional\", \"super-mega-fixe\", etc; * Compounds Nominal expressions integrating more than one form, e.g. \"trabalhador-estudante\", \"surdo-mudo\", \"lan\u00e7a-m\u00edsseis\", etc; * Neologisms;2014-07-30;toolService;http://hdl.handle.net/11372/LRT-1224;por;downloadable_files_count: 0;Portugal;NLX-Natural Language and Speech Group, University of Lisbon;http://lxinflector.di.fc.ul.pt",
