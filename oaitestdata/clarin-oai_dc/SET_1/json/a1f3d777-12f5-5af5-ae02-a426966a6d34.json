It contains parallel corpora for 11 languages paired with English, crawled from a large number of web sites. The selection of websites is based on CommonCrawl, but ParaCrawl is extracted from a brand new crawl which has much higher coverage of these selected websites than CommonCrawl. Since the data is fairly raw, it is released with two quality metrics that can be used for corpus filtering. An official \"clean\" version of each corpus uses one of the metrics.
