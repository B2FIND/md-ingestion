It contains over 11000 valency frames for more than 7000 verbs which occurred in the PDT or PCEDT. It is available in electronically processable format (XML) together with the aforementioned treebanks (to be viewed and edited by TrEd, the PDT/PCEDT main annotation tool), and also in more human readable form including corpus examples (see the WEBSITE link below).
