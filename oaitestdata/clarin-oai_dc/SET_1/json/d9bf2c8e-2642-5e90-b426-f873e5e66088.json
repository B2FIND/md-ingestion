The U-Compare platform allows users to build and evaluate NLP workflows. Workflows consist of one or more components, consisting of corpus readers and tools, such as tokenisers, POS taggers, named entity recognisers, etc. Workflows can be built using any components that are compliant with the UIMA framework. The Workbench provides several facilities, including rapid construction of workflows through drag and drop, graphical display of comparison of the performance of alternative workflows and evaluation against gold standard data, import of new UIMA components into the library and xport of components/workflows. \n;2013-02-15",
