In particular, Ciprian-Virgil Gerstenberger compiled the data set from the entire SIKOR Lule Saami corpus version 2015-10-10. The length of the N-grams ranges from unigrams (single words) to tri-grams (112877 unigrams, 552639 bigrams, 164286 trigrams). Only N-grams within sentences have been counted. The data format follows the ARPA backoff N-gram models and has been generated using SRILM, the SRI Language Modeling Toolkit (http://www.speech.sri.com/projects/srilm/). Since the N-grams have been derived automatically, they may contain wrong values.
