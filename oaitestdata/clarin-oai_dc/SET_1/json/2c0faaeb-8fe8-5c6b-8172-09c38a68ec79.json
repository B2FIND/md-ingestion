Test data will be published as a separate item.\r\n\r\nThis shared task will build on its previous four editions to further examine automatic methods for estimating the quality of machine translation output at run-time, without relying on reference translations. We include word-level, sentence-level and document-level estimation. The sentence and word-level tasks will explore a large dataset produced from post-editions by professional translators (as opposed to crowdsourced translations as in the previous year). For the first time, the data will be domain-specific (IT domain). The document-level task will use, for the first time, entire documents, which have been human annotated for quality indirectly in two ways: through reading comprehension tests and through a two-stage post-editing exercise. Our tasks have the following goals:\r\n\r\n- To advance work on sentence and word-level quality estimation by providing domain-specific, larger and professionally annotated datasets.\r\n- To study the utility of detailed information logged during post-editing (time, keystrokes, actual edits) for different levels of prediction.\r\n- To analyse the effectiveness of different types of quality labels provided by humans for longer texts in document-level prediction.\r\n\r\nThis year's shared task provides new training and test datasets for all tasks, and allows participants to explore any additional data and resources deemed relevant. A in-house MT system was used to produce translations for the sentence and word-level tasks, and multiple MT systems were used to produce translations for the document-level task. Therefore, MT system-dependent information will be made available where possible.;2016-02-29;corpus;http://hdl.handle.net/11372/LRT-1646;eng;deu;info:eu-repo/grantAgreement/EC/H2020/645452;http://hdl.handle.net/11372/LRT-1631;http://hdl.handle.net/11372/LRT-1974;AGREEMENT ON THE USE OF DATA IN QT21;https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/repository/xmlui/page/licence-TAUS_QT21;PUB;application/x-gzip;application/x-gzip;application/x-gzip;application/x-gzip;application/x-gzip;application/x-gzip;application/x-gzip;text/plain; charset=utf-8;downloadable_files_count: 7;University of Sheffield;http://www.statmt.org/wmt16/quality-estimation-task.html",
