The kernel of the morphological and syntactic lexicons was built in the framework of the European project \"Preparatory Action for Linguistic Resources Organisation for Language Engineering\" (LE-PAROLE). The linguistic model and the core of the semantic lexicon were elaborated within the European project \"Semantic Information for Multifunctional Plurilingual Lexica\" (LE-SIMPLE). The phonological level of the description and the extension of the lexical coverage were produced in the context of the Italian project \"Corpora e Lessici dell'Italiano Parlato e Scritto\" (CLIPS).

It was encoded at the semantic level, in full accordance with the international standards set out in the PAROLE-SIMPLE model and based on EAGLES. Syntactic and semantic encodings were performed jointly with Thamus (Consortium for Multilingual Documentary Engineering), which is responsible for 25,000 extra entries.
