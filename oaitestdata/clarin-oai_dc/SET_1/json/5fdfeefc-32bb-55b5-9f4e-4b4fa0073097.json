By using training texts in different languages (approx. 1.5Mb of text for each language), a training module counts the prefixes (the first 3 characters) and the suffixes (4 characters endings) for all the words in the texts, for each language. For every language two models are constructed, containing the weights (percentages) of prefixes and suffixes in the texts representing a language. In the prediction phase, for a new text, two models are built on the fly in a similar manner. These models are then compared with the stored models representing each language for which the application was trained. Using comparison functions, the best model is chose.
