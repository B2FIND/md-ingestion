The service may be run against plain text (input format: text), then the necessary processing steps will be run automatically (tagger and chunker). You can also process already tagged and chunked input (input format: ccl). The output will be enriched with inter-chunk relations. The service is based on a prototype implementation, hence it works slowly. The configuration used here operates on shallow syntactic annotation scheme from the KPWr corpus.;2011-12-30;toolService;http://hdl.handle.net/11321/8;pol;Creative Commons - Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0);http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/;CC;application/octet-stream;text/plain; charset=utf-8;downloadable_files_count: 1;Wroc\u0142aw University of Technology;http://ws.clarin-pl.eu/chunker.shtml",
