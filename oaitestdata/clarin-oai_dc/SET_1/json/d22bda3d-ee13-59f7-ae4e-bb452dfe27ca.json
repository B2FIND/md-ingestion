In particular, Ciprian-Virgil Gerstenberger compiled the data set from the entire SIKOR North Saami corpus version 2015-10-10.

The data format follows the ARPA backoff N-gram models and has been generated using SRILM, the SRI Language Modeling Toolkit (http://www.speech.sri.com/projects/srilm/). Since the N-grams have been derived automatically, they may contain wrong values.
