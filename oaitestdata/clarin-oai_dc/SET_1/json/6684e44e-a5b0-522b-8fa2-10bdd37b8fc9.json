Test data will be published as a separate item.\r\n\r\nThis shared task will build on its previous five editions to further examine automatic methods for estimating the quality of machine translation output at run-time, without relying on reference translations. We include word-level, phrase-level and sentence-level estimation. All tasks will make use of a large dataset produced from post-editions by professional translators. The data will be domain-specific (IT and Pharmaceutical domains) and substantially larger than in previous years. In addition to advancing the state of the art at all prediction levels, our goals include:\r\n\r\n- To test the effectiveness of larger (domain-specific and professionally annotated) datasets. We will do so by increasing the size of one of last year's training sets.\r\n- To study the effect of language direction and domain. We will do so by providing two datasets created in similar ways, but for different domains and language directions.\r\n- To investigate the utility of detailed information logged during post-editing. We will do so by providing post-editing time, keystrokes, and actual edits.\r\n\r\nThis year's shared task provides new training and test datasets for all tasks, and allows participants to explore any additional data and resources deemed relevant. A in-house MT system was used to produce translations for all tasks. MT system-dependent information can be made available under request.
