It currently consists of 88 hours of speech data, which corresponds roughly to 0.5 million tokens. The annotation process is semi-automatic, as we are able to perform the speech recognition on the data with high accuracy (over 90%) and consequently align the resulting automatic transcripts with the speech.

The resulting corpus is therefore suitable for both acoustic model training for ASR purposes and training of speaker identification and/or verification systems.
