As part of the JuBrain cytoarchitectonic atlas, the area was identified using cytoarchitectonic analysis on cell-body-stained histological sections of 10 human postmortem brains obtained from the body donor program of the University of D\u00fcsseldorf. The results of the cytoarchitectonic analysis were then mapped to the reference space, where each voxel was assigned the probability to belong to Area OP8 (Frontal Operculum).
