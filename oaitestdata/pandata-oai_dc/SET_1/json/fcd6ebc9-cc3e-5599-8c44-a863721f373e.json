        "In situ composite materials based upon refractory metal - silicide eutectics are being considered for high temperature structural applications.  These materials derive their high temperature strength from a creep-resistant silicide phase and toughening from a metallic matrix.  Directional solidification under planar growth front conditions can give rise to microstructures of aligned lamellae of these phase leading to considerable strength along the growth direction.  In this experiment it is proposed that the interphase stresses in a Cr-Cr3Si lamellar eutectic composite be investigated to determine its load partitioning behaviour during heating, elastic deformation at intermediate and high temperatures and how these interphase stresses evolve during creep deformation.",
