      <dc:description>Data from array experiments investigating pollinator behaviour on snapdragons in controlled conditions, and their effect on plant mating. Data were collected as part of Tom Ellis' PhD thesis , submitted February 2016.&#13;
&#13;
We placed a total of 36 plants in a grid inside a closed organza tent, with a single hive of commercially bred bumblebees (Bombus hortorum). We used only the yellow-flowered Antirrhinum majus striatum and the magenta-flowered Antirrhinum majus pseudomajus, at ratios of 6:36, 12:24, 18:18, 24:12 and 30:6.&#13;
&#13;
After 24 hours to learn how to deal with snapdragons, I observed pollinators foraging on plants, and recorded the transitions between plants. Thereafter seeds on plants were allowed to develops. A sample of these were grown to maturity when their flower colour could be determined, and they were scored as yellow, magenta, or hybrid.</dc:description>
