It consists of preprocessed multi-electrode array recording from 160 salamander retinal ganglion cells responding to 297 repeats of a 19 s natural movie. The data is available in two formats: (1) a .mat file containing an array with dimensions \u201cnumber of repeats\u201d x \u201cnumber of neurons\u201d x \u201ctime in a repeat\u201d; (2) a zipped .txt file containing the same data represented as an array with dimensions \u201cnumber of neurons\u201d x \u201cnumber of samples\u201d, where the number of samples is equal to the product of the number of repeats and timebins within a repeat. The time dimension is divided into 20 ms time windows, and the array is binary indicating whether a given cell elicited at least one spike in a given time window during a particular repeat.
