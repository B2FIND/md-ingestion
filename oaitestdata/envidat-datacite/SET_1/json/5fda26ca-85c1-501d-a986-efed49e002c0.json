The influence of isothermal and controlled temperature gradient conditions on the \u03b418O content in the snow and interstitial water vapor is elucidated. The observed disequilibrium between snow and vapor isotopes led to exchange of isotopes between snow and vapor under non-equilibrium processes, significantly changing the \u03b418O content of the snow.
