Here we provide daily mean values; values in sub-daily resolution can be provided on demand.\nRunoff has been measured at the outlet of three small (first-order) catchments of approximately 1 km2 area: Erlenbach (two independent runoff measurements), Vogelbach and L\u00fcmpenenbach. The catchments are similar with regard to geology (Flysch) and soil conditions (clay soils), but differ in forest coverage (20 to 60%).

Thus, the accuracy of the measurements at very large flow is limited. \nMeteorological variables have been measured on a meadow (Erlenh\u00f6he) located in the Erlenbach catchment at 1220 m a.s.l. using a standard meteorological station (incl. ventilated air temperature and heated rain gauges). In addition, precipitation has also been recorded at two other locations (in the Vogelbach and L\u00fcmpenenbach catchments).\nSnow measurements have been conducted weekly to monthly since 1968 at more than 15 locations (30-m transects) representing different altitudes, aspects and land uses (meadow, forest).
