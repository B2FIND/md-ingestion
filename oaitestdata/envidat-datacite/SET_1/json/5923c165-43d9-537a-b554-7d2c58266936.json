To this end, biomass and cover of the six main plant groups in the herb layer were collected from 405 1x1 m subplots on 135 study sites (15 sites in 9 strata) which were selected based on a stratified sampling approach. To ensure consistency with NFI methodology, study sites corresponded to the design of regular NFI sample plots and plant cover was estimated by trained field-crew members. Based on the dry weight of the plant biomass and the cover estimate on each subplot, a linear regression model was developed and applied to estimate herb layer biomass on each NFI sample plot.;47.0628584 7.195934012;46.79597556 7.581016377;46.66253488 7.426498306;47.51018267 8.82084427;47.39947643 9.160885554;46.9633825 8.731743039;46.18872018 8.797169613;46.08078867 8.93719123;46.35786287 9.197100398;Switzerland",
