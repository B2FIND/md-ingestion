The post-processing steps include the registration of the individual scans into a single 3-dimensional point cloud, the removal of unwanted noise caused by particles in the air (i.e., snow crystals), and the final generation of surface grids based on the cleaned individual point returns. The final product includes the \u2018xyz\u2019 coordinates of the individual point measurements, and gridded surfaces covering study areas of 100m x 100 m, and at resolutions of 0.01 m, 0.1 m, 0.25 m, 0.5 m and 1 m for each of the survey dates. Additionally, subgrid statistics that include the mean elevation, standard deviation, minimum and maximum elevations, range, and number of point returns in each gridcell are generated. The final product is provided in space-delimited text files, with the surface grids provided in Digital Terrain Model (DTM) format ready for visualization in any GIS software.\n\n###How to cite:\nPlease also cite the original publication when using this data set.: Trujillo, E., K.
