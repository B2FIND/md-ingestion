The TLS position is located approximately 30 vertical meters above the Gletschboden area at a northerly exposed slope. In total 44 TLS measurement sets have been conducted in three consecutive years 2014-2016 (2014: 13 measurements; 2015: 17 measurements; 2016: 14 measurements). The TLS system has a single-point measurement frequency of 300 kHz and a beam divergence of 0.007\u00b0.
