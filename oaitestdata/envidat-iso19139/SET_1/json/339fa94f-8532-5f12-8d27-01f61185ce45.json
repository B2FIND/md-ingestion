The experiment is located in a xeric mature Scots pine forest in the Pfynwald (46\u00b0 18' N, 7\u00b0 36' E, 615 m a.s.l.) in one of the driest inner-Alpine valleys of the European Alps, the Valais (mean annual temperature: 9.2\u00b0C, annual precipitation sum: 657 mm, both 1961-1990). Tree age is on average 100 years, the top height is 10.8 m and the stand density is 730 stems ha-1 with a basal area of 27.3 m2 ha-1. The forest is described as _Erico Pinetum sylvestris_ and the soil is a shallow pararendzina characterized by low water retention.

The amount of irrigation corresponds to a supplementary rainfall of 700 mm year-1. Trees in the other four plots grow under naturally dry conditions. Soil moisture has been monitored since the beginning of the project at 3 soil depths (10, 20 and 60 cm). The crown condition of each tree is being assessed each year since 2003. Tree measurement data such as diameter at breast height, tree height, and social status were assessed in 2002, 2009 and 2014.
