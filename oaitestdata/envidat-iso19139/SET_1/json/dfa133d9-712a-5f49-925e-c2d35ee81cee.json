Measurements were taken from two turbulence towers over a long-lasting snow patch, which are 5 m apart from each other (2014 and 2015). The turbulence towers were equipped with two YOUNG ultrasonic anemometers mounted 0.7 m (in 2014) and 3.3 m (in 2015) above snow-free ground, two ultrasonic anemometers (CSAT3, Campbell Scientific, Inc.) mounted at 2.6 m (in 2014) and 2.2 m (in 2015) above snow-free ground and one anemometer (DA-600, Kaijo Denki) mounted at 0.3 m above snow surface.      The measurement setup changed in 2016 and includes a measurement above the snow-free ground in upwind direction (Swiss coordinates: 790191/176689). The measurement tower is equipped with one ultrasonic anemometer (CSAT3, Campbell Scientific, Inc.) in 3.3 m above the snow-free ground. Additionally, one measurement tower is installed above the long-Lasting snow patch and equipped with the same setup as 2015.    Turbulence data were sampled at a frequency of 20 Hz. The processing of the data to quality controlled fluxes has been done with the Biomicrometeorology flux software (Thomas et al., 2009). The program applies plausibility tests and a despiking test after Vickers and Mahrt (1997) on the measured data. The routine further applies a time-lag correction and considers the deployment (e.g.  the sonic azimuth). A frequency response correction (Moore, 1986) is done and a three-dimensional rotation is performed. Finally, quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) flags after Foken et al., (2004) are issued and fast Fourier transform power and co-spectra are calculated.  The change in snow height is considered in the post-processing for every measurement day. The turbulence data were averaged to 30 minute intervals.;Rebecca Mott;SLF;mott@slf.ch;DISCHMEX;EDDY-COVARIANCE MEASUREMENTS;PATCHY SNOW COVERS;TURBULENT SENSIBLE HEAT FLUXES;Open Data Commons Open Database License (ODbL);Eng;MD_CharacterSetCode_utf8;9.92665 46.71291;ZIP;XLSX;PNG;https://www.envidat.ch/dataset/10-16904-10;HTTPS;DATASET METADATA;information;https://www.envidat.ch/dataset/7e8c6dac-80cf-49d7-bd85-2a61d3336e6f/resource/486e31a9-78e2-4736-9cad-a40c0958662c/download/s1-2014.zip;HTTPS;S1 2014;download;https://www.envidat.ch/dataset/7e8c6dac-80cf-49d7-bd85-2a61d3336e6f/resource/25ce04fb-452c-439e-b1fe-8ef2ccb1ea4e/download/s2-2014.zip;HTTPS;S2 2014;download;https://www.envidat.ch/dataset/7e8c6dac-80cf-49d7-bd85-2a61d3336e6f/resource/96640b5b-18e4-4de4-b19b-d8be3fabe9a6/download/s3-2014.zip;HTTPS;S3 2014;download;https://www.envidat.ch/dataset/7e8c6dac-80cf-49d7-bd85-2a61d3336e6f/resource/60ca7742-4ab9-49f6-9318-3dac0c4ae4bd/download/s4-2014.zip;HTTPS;S4 2014;download;https://www.envidat.ch/dataset/7e8c6dac-80cf-49d7-bd85-2a61d3336e6f/resource/fb937402-fc94-4121-9d55-809664005628/download/s5-2014.zip;HTTPS;S5 2014;download;https://www.envidat.ch/dataset/7e8c6dac-80cf-49d7-bd85-2a61d3336e6f/resource/9e551281-5120-4041-860e-8d2fc911c9dd/download/s3-2015.zip;HTTPS;S3 2015;download;https://www.envidat.ch/dataset/7e8c6dac-80cf-49d7-bd85-2a61d3336e6f/resource/3e7cd0af-60cb-4026-8e8f-7c0736c45f5b/download/s4-2015.zip;HTTPS;S4 2015;download;https://www.envidat.ch/dataset/7e8c6dac-80cf-49d7-bd85-2a61d3336e6f/resource/68c609d2-beb3-45b7-bbd4-cdf33de5f6e1/download/s1-2015.zip;HTTPS;S1 2015;download;https://www.envidat.ch/dataset/7e8c6dac-80cf-49d7-bd85-2a61d3336e6f/resource/81cb8412-b9bf-4ac8-a65b-7fdd0c597087/download/s2-2015.zip;HTTPS;S2 2015;download;https://www.envidat.ch/dataset/7e8c6dac-80cf-49d7-bd85-2a61d3336e6f/resource/d9037751-fbdf-438c-a1b0-03aa3301c065/download/s5-2015.zip;HTTPS;S5 2015;download;https://www.envidat.ch/dataset/7e8c6dac-80cf-49d7-bd85-2a61d3336e6f/resource/b5c85840-bf9f-4605-b4c7-9d05b00f2cdc/download/s1-2016.zip;HTTPS;S1 2016;download;https://www.envidat.ch/dataset/7e8c6dac-80cf-49d7-bd85-2a61d3336e6f/resource/e78a7861-5a9d-458f-b66d-d180292f6840/download/s2-2016.zip;HTTPS;S2 2016;download;https://www.envidat.ch/dataset/7e8c6dac-80cf-49d7-bd85-2a61d3336e6f/resource/0425d29f-b2cd-4092-afe6-00ca6fbd2303/download/s3-2016.zip;HTTPS;S3 2016;download;https://www.envidat.ch/dataset/7e8c6dac-80cf-49d7-bd85-2a61d3336e6f/resource/43081c3a-5d6c-4f7c-9259-b221e82f9b61/download/s5-2016.zip;HTTPS;S5 2016;download;https://www.envidat.ch/dataset/7e8c6dac-80cf-49d7-bd85-2a61d3336e6f/resource/c97df0fe-0691-4123-9d12-73909311f289/download/outputexplanation.xlsx;HTTPS;OUTPUT EXPLANATION;download;https://www.envidat.ch/dataset/7e8c6dac-80cf-49d7-bd85-2a61d3336e6f/resource/622ba326-7828-4f83-868c-94ad784c1841/download/gletschboden.png;HTTPS;GLETSCHBODEN SETUP;download",
