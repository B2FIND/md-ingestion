Individuals were from the St. Michael's Litten, Chichester assemblage (dated AD1550-1900) held at University College London. Sets of photographs are numbered according to specimen number. Specimen numbers are 1892, 2359, 2583, 2729, 4759. The specimen numbers correspond to the skeleton numbers of each individual. The site code for St. Michael's Litten is ESC11.
